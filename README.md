# Retro Car Performance Model 🚗📈

This is a machine learning project built with Node.js and TensorFlow.js aimed at exploring and predicting the relationship between car horsepower and fuel efficiency (MPG) in vintage cars from the 1970s era.

## Overview 🔭

This project serves as a learning platform to delve into machine learning techniques, specifically linear regression with gradient descent, to analyze and predict MPG based on car horsepower using a curated dataset of classic automobiles from the 1970s.

## Features 🌟

- **Data Exploration:** 📊 Analyze vintage car data, understand trends, and preprocess information for modeling.
- **Linear Regression:** 📈 Implement a predictive model to estimate MPG from car horsepower using TensorFlow.js and gradient descent.
- **Evaluation:** 🧪 Assess model accuracy, tune parameters, and validate results.
- **Visualization:** 📉 Display visual insights and regression analysis results as graphs. Graphs will be generated in `png` format inside the `data/` directory.
